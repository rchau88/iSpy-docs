
## Running iSpy with docker-compose (test for github actions)

The iSpy's dashboard relies on four Docker containers to run its genome assembly and curation: **IRMA**, **DAIS-Ribosome**, **spyne**, and **iSpy**. Presently, IRMA and DAIS-Ribosome docker images are stored in **AWSâ€™s ECR**, a public gallery for sharing and deploying container images. Both images can be pulled down and built into runnable containers with ```docker pull``` and ```docker run``` commands. On the other hand, spyne and iSpy docker images can be built directly from their respective **Github repository** and with a specified **target branch** using ```docker build``` and ```docker run``` commands.

Although we can pull down each of the four required images one by one and run its container, to ease our process and reduce repetitive tasks, we can utilize **docker-compose** to pull all of the images down at once, build its containers, and configure them to communicate with each other. All these tasks can be accomplished using a **docker-compose.yml** file.

There are two versions of the docker-compose.yml files:

- [Development version](#build-development-version-of-ispy) for continuous integration of the application
- [Production version](#build-production-version-of-ispy) for deployment of the application

## Software requirements

- Docker version >= 20.10,
- Git version >= 2.21
- Docker-compose version >= 1.29

## Build development version of iSpy

This version allows you to mount the code base that is needed to develop the `iSpy` dashboard and `spyne` pipeline. Any updates or changes to the code will automatically reflects the changes inside their Docker containers. This allows continuous integration (CI) of the application.

### (1) Clone spyne respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/spyne.git
``` 

### (2) Clone iSpy respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/iSpy.git
``` 

### (3) CD to `iSpy` folder where `docker-compose-git-dev.yml` is stored and edit the yaml file to link the data inputs and code base to appropriate containers

- Mount data to **/data** directory inside of all containers: change **/path/to/data** to your **iSpy/data** directory
- Mount code base of **spyne** to **/spyne** directory inside the **spyne** container: change **/path/to/spyne** to your **spyne** directory
- Mount code base of **iSpy** to **/iSpy** directory inside the **ispy** container: change **/path/to/iSpy** to your **iSpy** directory

```bash
version: "3.9"

x-dais-version:
  &dais-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/dais-ribosome:1.2.1

x-irma-version:
  &irma-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/irma:1.0.2p3

x-spyne-version:
  &spyne-version 
  https://github.com/nbx0/spyne.git#prod

x-ispy-version:
  &ispy-version 
  https://github.com/nbx0/iSpy.git#prod 

x-data-volumes:
  &data-volume
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/data
  target: /data

x-docker-volumes:
  &docker-socket
  type: bind
  source: /var/run/docker.sock 
  target: /var/run/docker.sock 

x-spyne-volumes:
  &spyne-code
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/spyne
  target: /spyne 

x-ispy-volumes:
  &ispy-code
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/iSpy
  target: /iSpy
```

### (4) Start all services listed in the docker-compose-git-dev.yml file

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-git-dev.yml up -d 
```

**-f**: name of the docker-compose file <br>
**-d**: run the containers in detached mode <br>

For more information about the docker-compose syntax, see [docker-compose up reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/)

### (5) To check if the services are started sucessfully

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-git-dev.yml ps

```

### (6) Access the `iSpy` dashboard on the host network

You can visit the local host using your preferred web browser, type in http://localhost:8010, and check if the dashboard is indeed hosted there.


## Build production version of iSpy

This version **ONLY** allows you to mount the data files that are needed to run **IRMA**, **DAIS-Ribosome**, **spyne**, and **iSpy** containers. In other words, you do not have access to their code base but is using their latest containerized version of the code.


### (1) Clone irma-spy-testdata respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/irma-spy-testdata.git
```

### (2) CD to `iSpy` folder where `docker-compose-git.yml` is stored and edit the yaml file to link the data inputs to appropriate containers

- Mount data to `/data` directory inside of all containers: change `/path/to/data` to your `iSpy/data` directory

```bash
version: "3.9"

x-dais-version:
  &dais-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/dais-ribosome:1.2.1

x-irma-version:
  &irma-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/irma:1.0.2p3

x-spyne-version:
  &spyne-version 
  https://github.com/nbx0/spyne.git#prod

x-ispy-version:
  &ispy-version 
  https://github.com/nbx0/iSpy.git#prod 

x-data-volumes:
  &data-volume
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/data
  target: /data

x-docker-volumes:
  &docker-socket
  type: bind
  source: /var/run/docker.sock 
  target: /var/run/docker.sock 
```

### (3) Start all services listed in the docker-compose-git.yml file

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-git.yml up -d 
```

**-f**: name of the docker-compose file <br>
**-d**: run the containers in detached mode <br>

For more information about the docker-compose syntax, see [docker-compose up reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/)

### (4) To check if the services are started sucessfully

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-git.yml ps

```

### (5) Access the `iSpy` dashboard on the host network

You can visit the local host using your preferred web browser, type in http://localhost:8020, and check if the dashboard is indeed hosted there.

**NOTE:** Here we are publishing the `iSpy` dashboard on port **8020** on the host machine. This port is different from the **development** version which was previously launched on port **8010**.
